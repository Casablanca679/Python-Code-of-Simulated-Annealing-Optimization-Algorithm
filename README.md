Python Code of Simulated Annealing Optimization Algorithm Code From the Youtube Channel  "Solving Optimization Problem"  All Kudos to him.

Ran on Visual studio, just copy this into a new python project and it should run. 
Please Remember that if you get missing "numppy" errors etc ensure you download the respective directories and restart the IDE.
Also I couldnt get the graph to output in console, if you solve the issue, let me know.
